// That's a good summary of the key differences between Emulated, Shadow DOM, and None View Encapsulation in Angular when it comes to styles:

// - **Emulated View Encapsulation**: Component styles are scoped to the component, meaning they only affect elements within that component's view.

// - **Shadow DOM View Encapsulation**: Component styles are scoped to the component and its child components. Shadow DOM creates a separate DOM tree for each component, encapsulating both the component's styles and its child components' styles.

// - **None View Encapsulation**: Component styles are not scoped and can potentially affect the entire application, including other components and elements.

// Your understanding is correct. These encapsulation modes give you control over how styles are applied and scoped in your Angular application, allowing you to choose the level of isolation and encapsulation that best suits your project's requirements.

// 1.Emulated View Encapsulation (Default):
// Emulated encapsulation is the default for Angular components. It emulates the Shadow DOM behavior by adding unique attributes to the components' DOM elements. This ensures that the component's styles don't affect other parts of the application and vice versa.

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-emulated',
  template: `
    <div class="emulated-box">
      This is an Emulated View Encapsulation example.
    </div>
  `,
  styleUrls: ['./emulated.component.css'],
})
export class EmulatedComponent {}


// 2. Shadow DOM View Encapsulation:
// To enable Shadow DOM encapsulation, you can use the encapsulation property in the component metadata:

import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-shadow-dom',
  template: `
    <div class="shadow-dom-box">
      This is a Shadow DOM View Encapsulation example.
    </div>
  `,
  styleUrls: ['./shadow-dom.component.css'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom,
})
export class ShadowDomComponent {}


// 3. None View Encapsulation:
// None view encapsulation means that the styles defined in a component can potentially affect other parts of the application. It's important to use this carefully.

import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-none',
  template: `
    <div class="none-box">
      This is a None View Encapsulation example.
    </div>
  `,
  styleUrls: ['./none.component.css'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,
})
export class NoneComponent {}


// Style Files:
// Each of the components above references a CSS file (e.g., emulated.component.css, shadow-dom.component.css, and none.component.css) that contains the component-specific styles. These styles are scoped to the component by default in emulated and Shadow DOM encapsulation modes.

// Remember that while disabling view encapsulation with ViewEncapsulation.None can be powerful, it should be used sparingly and with caution to avoid unintended styling conflicts in larger applications.
